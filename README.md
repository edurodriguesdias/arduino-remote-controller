## Remote Control Arduino
Just a small project to create custom sequence of commands to control your devices

## Philips Controller Commands HEX
Here we have a small part of a lot buttons may be mapped. So, if you want map HEX codes from another controller or, you need a specific code that we don't provided here, you can remove comments from lines #&, #18 and #24 of `remote_controller.ino` file. After removing those comments, you can use your controller to see which HEX code represents each button you want to know.
