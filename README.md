A compact project aimed at developing a customizable sequence of commands to remotely control devices using Arduino components.

## Philips Controller HEX Commands
This section contains a subset of buttons that can be mapped. If you wish to map HEX codes from another controller or require a specific code not provided here, simply uncomment lines #7, #18, and #24 in the remote_controller.ino file. After removing these comments, you can use your controller to identify the HEX code corresponding to each desired button.
